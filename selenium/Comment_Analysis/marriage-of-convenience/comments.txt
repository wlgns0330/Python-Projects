    "I must have clicked an ad when I wasn't looking, I was reading ORV and they were talking about the grim origin of an item and that's when it went to this story. the whole time I was reading this I was thinking \"wow this is an incredibly elaborate backstory for the demon pellet\"",
    "Wait am I misunderstanding something or did they get married when she was 9 years old? It says they were married for 9 years and that she's 18 now...?",
    "I honestly feel bad for the husband. he had to marry a frewkin 9 year old. because she (presumably) never grew up with actual parents, she grew up to be a brat and because the Husband does nothing but take pity on her, he does his best to be a good husband, only to have a wife who spends all the money on herself.",

  "episode-2": [
    "help i just realized that if they were expected to consummate their marriage she would have been nine☠️",
    "I don’t think she even knows how expensive it is to get that white fox, shes been there since childhood and has just been given whatever shes wanted. I dont think they ever said no thats too expensive",
    "This is so sad. She clearly married him when she was a child so of course she’d be immature and spend a lot of money, the poor girl simply just didn’t know, she wasn’t evil or anything. I get it was cause this is set in medieval times so for them to be married young is normal but it’s still ac really sad. Whatever gave her the chance to relive her life must have understood and pitied her.",
    "Wait... She was 11?? OMG author, what is wrong with you?",
    "Y’all this is seriously such a good comic I promise",
    "so wait how old is the count 😀✋",

    "Poor Vincent listening at the door....",
    "ha! really wasn't expecting that...so straightforward that I almost feel second hand embarrassment just thinking about what the ml reaction will be",
    "Hold up so they have been married since they were ten!!!?!??! \nThat’s a little suspicious",
    "Bianca knows how to start a conversation... pure gold!",
    "to all the people shocked at her age of marriage: THEY WERE NOT expected to consumate the marriage at that time. for example, marie antoinette married when she was 14 and was send to france (essentially a proof of good will and trust on her family's part) but her first child was born 8 years later. there are of course exceptions, because creeps have  always existed, but even in medivial times people were well aware, that children should not bear children. that of course does not make it ok.",
    "Wait if she was 9 how old was the count😐🤔🫣😑",
    "so those dumbass maids complained about a 9 year marriage not bearing fruit even though they married at like 9 yrs old and he's been at war for a good chunk of that time... wtf...?",
    "15 years since she seen him n she’s 18? her dad was crazy!😰😭(bro @webtoon, if they’re restricted words in my comment, it’d be easier if you would just show me which word or symbols?!",

    "Omg the mixed feelings on this one...",
    "am I the only one who disagrees with her idea of having a child purely to preserve her life of luxury? I mean, sure, she's going to have character development but MC is so self centred, who's to say she'll treat the child nicely?",
    "And here we thought she was gonna use this second chance to be better... She's too selfish. 😮‍💨",
    "Bianca, noooo. noooo, noooo. consent is important",
    "uh,, not really the direction we should go, babe...",
    "gang, i'm scared for his safety... 😬",
    "I mean she has the spirit but let’s just dial it down a little bit",
    "girl. marital rape is NOT the way to go.",
    "lesson of the webtoon: communication is 🗝️.",
    "I like him very much. He's bathing first thing when he gets home because he knows she doesn't like the smell of the battlefield. He's sweet.",
    "Well we know FL is 18...but what is ML's age??",
    "I’m afraid the math isn’t mathing - how can she be wed for 15 years and only be 18 years old? Did I read it right?!",
    "are we really reading a story about a girl who’s only purpose after being brought back to life is to get pregnant…? like, no other goal? don’t wanna better yourself? find a plan B? improve on your personality? 💀",
    "Nah I hate this female lead. Shes so embarrassing. Force yourself onto someone is not okay. She’s a disgusting person. Shes a pretend victim, her life is marvelous but she squandered it herself",
    "no ma'am, we do not force anyone"

  "episode-4": [
    "\"clench your teeth\" a second away from world's hardest slap 💀💀💀💀💀 iconic if you as me",
    "I'm curious to see why she behaved that way. It's a nice change to have a protagonist who's not perfect",
    "We just skipping over he married a child? Yep Ok then. Least she had a guardian…",
    "￼ Sorry,, I have a question what is the age gap and should I be worried? ￼",
    "That was a slap above a slap damn!",
    "is anyone else uncomfortable with the age gap...? especially because it seems like she was very much a literal child (11), and he looks like he was very much a grown man. at least we know we know he wasn't sleeping with her, but still",
    "“She will be an adult soon!” “Why haven’t they made an heir?” Ummmm, those two things shouldn’t go together",
    "hey so what's their age gap....",
    "11 is so young oh my",
    "I figure we’ll have a growth arc soon,  but girl needs to work on her personality and reputation. The maid deserved that slap but it won’t do our girl any favors.",
    "why does he look so older than her 🥲",
    "A lot of people are still commenting on the age gap and how icky it feels.  I want to point out that the marriage was not her decision, but also not his either.  Their parents are entirely to blame; our two mains are just trying their best to make it work out in everyone's favor so nobody suffers from it.  This is proven in his willingness to keep her at a distance until both were adults, as well as his desire to do anything to keep her happy even at the expense of his own state.",
    "Well.... it was well deserved",
    "ate.",
    "okay what's the age gap😀",
    "I’ve never been so early to such a good WEBTOON, first time kinda nervous 😣",
    "why is everyone so harsh on a child? people are gossiping on a kid for not bearing a child when she barely came of age at the time??? \"the count is too good for her blabla\" have you thought about the fact that you're comparing a child to an adult?",
    "NAAAAHHH THAT AGE DIFFERENCE IS ACTUALLY INSANE HES FULLY GROWN AND SHES LIKE 10",
    "Bro. “Such a selfish woman” when she isn’t even an adult and most of the servants don’t even seem to expect her to have a kid until she’s an adult?",
    "she really put some force behind that"

  "episode-5": [
    "listen.. I'm not against this 😅 sometimes it's nice to have a mc who's not super righteous.. and it's not like she's doing anything out of the ordinary for this time period...",
    "I support women’s rights but most importantly I support women’s wrongs.",
    "This is far more different than the other reincarnation webtoons,where the cold one's get warmer to the people around them in their new life.. and I'm loving this already",
    "Alright I’m obsessed. She’s been told her whole life that she’s too good for the life she has. She was sold off and has been alone since she was a child and it’s turned her into a cruel, selfish person. She has her reasons and she’s sticks to them, even if they’re outwardly irrational. I’m so curious how she became a saint in her past life while preserving her victim mentality!",
    "I think she is going too far. However, this is historically accurate. Plus, the maidservant would just sabotage her again unless she is dismissed, maimed or dead. So, everything the Countess is saying isn’t inaccurate. Also, maidservant gossiped a lot based on her comfort in badmouthing. So, not sure how this is going to pan out: but, I’m intrigued thus far.",
    "love how expressive her eyes are!",
    "and this is where we split chat",
    "i swear ppl get mad when the mc is too docile and is a pushover but yall also get upset when they’re not? like😭i get it, maybe, but that’s literally the whole point of a redemption arc and even THEN, give it some time, it’s a 100000/10 webcomic and we just started",
    "she is easily one of my favourite imperfectly perfect fl ever. I am so glad this is uploading here.",
    "it's totally normal to react like that when u are not totally different person from your previous life . Moreover , anyone don't wanna hear some other woman about warming her husband's bed and it's more disrespectful coming from someone who is a servant and a  bi**h . Anyone who acts out of their place and only meant harm to other needs to be punished.",
    "the slap was fine but this is a little crazy 😭 but at the same time why is everybody hating on her when she's literally a CHILD???? HOW OLD IS THE COUNT???",
    "everyone believes that this punishment is way too harsh because we're so used to reading reincarnated stories where the FL comes from a different world or era. but you guys have to understand firing her is A LOT worse of a punishment than whipping her in these times. physical punishment is a lot more endurable compared to your financial stability being cut w/ nothing to back you up. since its the winter, staff is less likely to get hired because that's more money spent 2 keep em alive.",
    "Idk about yall but that servant did humiliate the lady of the house in the open. If same thing happens now everyone will blast them in social media. Ive just seen a woman who fired her nanny because nanny acted like mother of the kid. And she posted everything in social media. 300k comments are bashing the nanny. What she’s doing here isn’t any different.",
    "I don’t think she did anything wrong, she is just punishing that maid like how a parent would to a bratty child. And each whip has a reason. She is not whipping without counting. One is to slander her master’s name and another is to replace her master. I don’t get why people are siding with the maid?",
    "For all the rich people out there, I hope you have fun... 🫡🫡🫡",
    "dang shes taking it way too far i hope she learns to be kinder",
    "So, they were married when she was around 9, I’m guessing he was a minor too, but definitely had hit puberty by the picture. And he didn’t touch her at all, which is good. But, everyone is blaming her for not having a baby by now. And she’s been a child for most of the nine years they’ve been married and everyone is calling her a wicked wife? That line of thinking is twisted and messed up…but unfortunately not too far from reality (the way people twist things to blame others).",
    "ykw, it's refreshing to see a FL not changing her personality just coz she time travelled back to her past. i have read many webtoons where the FL suddenly changes her demeanour and everything opposite. i like this version where one day she suddenly hasn't changed her personality. and i also like how she agrees with being a cold and bad wife and she is not enraged by that comment. She got triggered when the maid commented on her bed skills and all....\nthanks author",
    "too excessive huh ?.....gods if you know how our schools are in South Asia ,you'll think what Bianca did was  the minimum .i have seen enough of these punishments in real life that seeing this i dont even flinch now .",
    "i don’t defend the MC whatsoever but i completely understand why she acts out like this. the poor thing was married off as a child and treated badly like ofc she would turn out cruel. i just hope she tries to fix her character this time"
